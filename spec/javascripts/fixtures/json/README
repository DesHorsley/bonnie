Contents of measures.json were created using:

  json = Measure.in(measure_id: ['0002', '0022']).to_json(except: [:map_fns, :record_ids], methods: [:value_sets])
  File.write('measures.json', JSON.pretty_generate(JSON.parse(json)))

(Note that we're including value sets in the measure JSON even though
our client side code doesn't use it; that's because this JSON is also
needed to generate the calculation code for the tests)

Contents of patients.json were generated using:

  json = Record.order_by('last first').to_json
  File.write('patients.json', JSON.pretty_generate(JSON.parse(json)))

Contents of value_sets.json were generated using

  oids = Measure.in(measure_id: ['0002', '0022']).pluck(:value_set_oids).flatten.uniq
  json = HealthDataStandards::SVS::ValueSet.in(oid: oids).index_by(&:oid).to_json
  File.write('value_sets.json', JSON.pretty_generate(JSON.parse(json)))
