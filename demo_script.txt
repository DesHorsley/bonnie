Demo Script (Target 12/22/2013)

1. User logs into the application, and is presented with the measure dashboard. Two measures are loaded (use rake bonnie:db:reset DEMO=true).
2. User selects the Upload measure button which brings up the upload dialog.
3. User navigates to the file 05_DischargedonAntithromboticThe_Artifacts_DEMO.zip the MAT export of NQF0435 Discharged on Antithrombotic Therapy
    - This is a relatively simple EH measure with one population that is episode of care
4. User selects EH and Episode of care on the upload dialog.
5. User clicks the load button to dismiss the dialog, the measure loads, and the user is presented with the finalize dialog
6. On the finalize dialog the user selects Encounter, Performed: Inpatient Encounter as the episode of care
7. User clicks done to dismiss the finalize dialog.
8. User is returned to the measure dashboard with the NQF0435 loaded.
9. User clicks on the measure title to navigate to the measure view.
10. On the measure view, the user can see the Measure title and descriptions. The user can also see the NQF logic of the measure (default display until we figure out the compressed view).
11. The user clicks on add patient from the measure view to add a patient to the measure and is presented with the patient builder dialog.
12. The user names the patient "Ischemic No Meds" and provides an expectation that the patient will be in the IPP and DENOM.
13. The user can somehow get access to the measure logic to refer to while building the patient (NQF View)
14. Based on the logic, the user adds the following to the patient:

  Name: Ischemic, No Meds
  DOB: 10/10/1970 00:00
  Expected Values: IPP, DENOM
  Encounter, Performed: Inpatient Encounter
    start: 11/07/2012 06:00
    end: 11/09/2012 06:00
    dischard_date_time: 11/09/2012 06:00
  Diagnosis, Active: Ischemic Stroke
    start: 11/08/2012 00:00
    end: 11/08/2012 01:00
    ordinal: Attribute Principal Diagnosis

15. The user saves the patient which takes them to the measure view where they can see the results of the calculation. (Assuming calculation on the patient builder is not yet supported)
16. The user can see the results of the calculation highlighted on the NQF Logic, the fact that there's a 100% match with expectations, and what populations the patient ended up in.
17. The user clones the "Ischemic No Meds" patient to create an "Ischemic With Meds" patient. This brings up the patient builder view with the fields pre-populated from the previous patient.
18. The user changes the name to "Ischemic With Meds", changes the expectation to include the numerator, and adds

  Name: Ischemic, With Meds
  Expected Values: IPP, DENOM, NUM
  Medication, Discharge: Antithrombotic Therapy
    start: 11/09/2012 05:00
    end: 11/09/2012 05:00

19. The user saves the patient and is taken to the measure view and can now see two patients.
20. The user clones the "Ischemic No Meds" patient to create a "Hemorrhagic No Meds" patient. This brings up the patient builder view with the fields pre-populated from the previous patient.
21. The user changes the name to "Hemorrhagic No Meds", changes the expected values to just IPP, deletes the Diagnosis, Active: Ischemic Stroke, and adds

  Name: Hemorrhagic, No Meds
  Expected Values: IPP
  Diagnosis, Active: Hemorrhagic Stroke
    start: 11/08/2012 00:00
    end: 11/08/2012 01:00
    ordinal: Attribute Principal Diagnosis

22. The user saves the patient and is taken to the measure view and can now see three patients, one failing.
23. The user sees that one of the patients is failing the test; we know that Hemorrhagic stroke patients should not receive Antithrombotic Therapy, but our measure is still considering this patient to be part of the denominator; the measure logic doesn't correctly reflect the intent, and needs to be updated.
24. User selects the Update Measure button which brings up the upload dialog.
25. User navigates to the file 05_DischargedonAntithromboticThe_Artifacts.zip the MAT export of NQF0435 Discharged on Antithrombotic Therapy
26. User clicks the load button to dismiss the dialog and the measure loads
27. User is returned to the measure view with the NQF0435 re-loaded.
28. User notes that all patients are now passing
